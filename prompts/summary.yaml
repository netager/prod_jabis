  You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. 
  Repeat the following 2 steps 3 times. 

  Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (";" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary. 
  Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities. 

  A missing entity is:

  - relevant to the main story, 
  - specific yet concise (100 words or fewer), 
  - novel (not in the previous summary), 
  - faithful (present in the article), 
  - anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).

  Guidelines:

  - The first summary should be long (8-10 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~200 words.
  - Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
  - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
  - The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article. 
  - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
  - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. 

  Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.
